# Deprecated, use [Vivify](https://github.com/jannis-baum/vivify)

This was my attempt at building local relative file links into
`iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim`, but then I decided to build my own Markdown
viewer instead. If you are interested in the relative links, check out
[Vivify](https://github.com/jannis-baum/vivify); it has most of the same
features, plus the relative links and the ability to work both with as well as
without Vim, i.e. you can also use it as just a viewer.
